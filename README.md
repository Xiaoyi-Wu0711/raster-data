# raster-data
PRIO-GRID is a vector grid network with a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees, covering all terrestrial areas of the world(https://grid.prio.org/#/download). 

The mining area data are polygons delineated by experts using Sentinel-2 cloudless with 0.5 * 0.5 decimal degree resoultion(https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.910894
).

This repo uses the mining area raster data to capture mining status of each prio grid on Earth.
